          <h2 class="article-title">Top 5 Movies of All Time</h2>
          <p class="article-date">May 14, 2025</p>
          <div class="article-body">
            <p>
              At <span class="respawn-logo">Cinema Courtroom</span>, our mission
              is to deliver fair, thought-provoking reviews that cut through the
              hype and get to the heart of every film. While there are thousands
              of incredible movies out there, a few stand the test of time,
              trial after trial. Here's our court-approved verdict on the top 5
              greatest movies of all time.
            </p>
            <div class="movie-entry">
              <h3 class="movie-title">1. The Godfather (1972)</h3>
              <p>
                Francis Ford Coppola's mafia epic is more than just a film; it's
                a cinematic institution. With rich characters, morally grey
                storytelling, and a haunting score,
                <em>The Godfather</em> redefined what film could be.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Timeless Masterpiece</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Why we love it:</strong> Every line, glance, and shadow
                feels deliberate and iconic. Marlon Brando's Don Corleone is a
                masterclass in restrained power.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="movie-entry">
              <h3 class="movie-title">2. Parasite (2019)</h3>
              <p>
                Bong Joon-ho's genre-bending social satire became a global
                phenomenon. With themes of class division, morality, and
                desperation, <em>Parasite</em> is as entertaining as it is
                unsettling.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Modern Genius</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Why we love it:</strong> It's rare to find a movie that
                balances humour, horror, and critique so seamlessly.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="movie-entry">
              <h3 class="movie-title">3. Pulp Fiction (1994)</h3>
              <p>
                Tarantino's nonlinear crime story broke the rules and made new
                ones. <em>Pulp Fiction</em> thrives on dialogue, energy, and
                unapologetic chaos.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Cult Classic, Deservedly So</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Why we love it:</strong> The pop culture references, the
                soundtrack, the dancing — it's all oddly poetic.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="movie-entry">
              <h3 class="movie-title">4. Spirited Away (2001)</h3>
              <p>
                Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece blends fantasy, childhood wonder,
                and spiritual themes into a truly magical experience.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Animated Brilliance</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Why we love it:</strong> It's beautiful, imaginative,
                and emotionally rich — proving animation is not just for kids.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="movie-entry">
              <h3 class="movie-title">5. Casablanca (1942)</h3>
              <p>
                A wartime love story that's never lost its charm.
                <em>Casablanca</em> continues to win hearts with its timeless
                dialogue and bittersweet ending.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Forever Romantic</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Why we love it:</strong> Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid
                Bergman's chemistry, combined with a script that gave us “Here's
                looking at you, kid,” keeps this classic forever relevant.

          <h2 class="article-title">The Rise of Indie Filmmaking in 2025</h2>
          <p class="article-date">May 10, 2025</p>
          <p class="article-body">
            Independent films have taken the industry by storm this year, with
            festivals like Sundance and TIFF showcasing groundbreaking work from
            new directors. These films, often made on modest budgets, prioritize
            storytelling and innovation over star power. For instance, the
            recent hit <em>Echoes of Silence</em> stunned audiences with its raw
            cinematography and compelling character arcs. At Cinema Courtroom,
            we believe indie films are reshaping how we analyze narrative depth
            and visual style. Stay tuned as we dive deeper into the techniques
            that make these films resonate with audiences worldwide.

            Why Nostalgic Films Are Making a Comeback
          </h2>
          <p class="article-date">May 5, 2025</p>
          <p class="article-body">
            Nostalgia is a powerful force in cinema, and 2025 is proving it.
            From reboots of classic 90s films to period pieces that capture the
            essence of bygone eras, audiences are flocking to theaters for a
            dose of familiarity. Films like <em>Retro Waves</em> blend modern
            cinematography with vintage aesthetics, creating a unique viewing
            experience. Our team at Cinema Courtroom has been analyzing why
            these films strike a chord, focusing on their use of character
            development and thematic resonance. Join us as we explore this trend
            and its impact on modern cinema.

          <h2 class="article-title">Breaking Down the Art of Cinematography</h2>
          <p class="article-date">April 28, 2025</p>
          <p class="article-body">
            Cinematography is the backbone of any great film, and this year's
            releases are pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling. From the
            sweeping landscapes of <em>Horizon's End</em> to the intimate
            close-ups in <em>Whispers of Time</em>, directors are using the
            camera to tell stories in innovative ways. At Cinema Courtroom,
            we're dissecting these techniques, exploring how lighting, framing,
            and movement enhance narrative depth. Whether you're a casual viewer
            or a film buff, our analysis will help you appreciate the artistry
            behind the lens.
